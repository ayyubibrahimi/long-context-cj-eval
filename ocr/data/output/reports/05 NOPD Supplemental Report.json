Earlier\nthis date Jessie Bibbins and Kendall Gordon kicked in the front door of Patrice\nCommodore's residence. Both masked perpetrators demanded all the occupants of the\nresidence lay on the floor. The perpetrators then demanded money and vehicle keys.\nDuring the course of the home invasion Patrice Commodore was confronted by Jessie\nBibbins at the entrance of her bedroom. At that point the witnesses heard one gunshot.\nGordon and Bibbins then fled the residence of foot. Minutes later Jessie Bibbins was\nfound unresponsive on the front lawn of 1713 Mazant Street. Bibbins suffered a single\ngunshot wound to the neck.\nPatrice Commodore was treated on the scene by Emergency Medical Technicians and\nwas pronounced dead at 10:00PM by Doctor Ronald Vasari of University Medical\nCenter. Jessie Bibbins was treated on the scene at 1713 Mazant Street by Emergency\nMedical Technicians. Bibbins was pronounced dead on the scene at 10:32PM also by\nDoctor Vasari.\nWhile on the Tricou Street scene Detective Morton met with Fifth District Detective\nGregory Johnson, who advised him the perpetrator described by the eyewitnesses with\ntattoos of crosses on his face matched the description of a subject known to Fifth District\nOfficers as \"Kendall Gordon\". With the information provided by Detective Johnson\nDetective Morton developed Kendall Gordon, black male, of 1424 Kentucky Street as a\nsuspect.\nA member of the Jessie Bibbins' family, Nicole Johnson, identified his remains on the\nMazant Street Scene. Based on the description given by one of the two eyewitnesses to\nthe Tricou Street shooting, and the proximity of two scenes Jessie Bibbins, black male of\n1815 Carondelet Street, was developed as a suspect.\nHomicide Investigators interviewed two eyewitnesses at the Homicide Office.\nDarceleen Commodore advised Detective Morton she observed the suspect's faces and\nknew one of the subjects from the neighborhood. Witness Earlita Taylor stated she did\nnot see the perpetrator's faces.\nVia photographic line-up Darceleen Commodore positively identified Kendall Gordon\nas one of the two subjects, who entered her home at gunpoint. Commodore was 90% sure\nthe second subject was Jessie Bibbins. Based on the information received during the\ncourse of the investigation and the positive identification of Kendall Gordon an arrest\nwarrant was issued for Gordon for two counts of First Degree Murder.",

The structure consisted of a single\nstory and comprised of a yellow colored brick. The front of the structure contained a\nwhite colored front door, which was illuminated by an overhead porch light and was\ncovered by a small overhang. Above this door, Detective Morton observed a small\nsurveillance camera mounted to the wall. Two small patches of grass were situated in\nfront of the residence and were divided by a concrete walkway which lead to the front\ndoor. Detective Morton noted that four (4) orange evidence cones were positioned in\nfront of the residence and traveled away from the house as indicated by there ascending\nnumbers.

These cones were identified as numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6. They marked the\nfollowing evidence:\n#3- Blood spatter from the ground under the front door overhang, commonly identified as\na porch\n#4- Blood spatter in the driveway of 1808 Tricou Street.\n#5- Blood spatter in the driveway of 1808 Tricou Street.",

The vehicle parked nearest to the residence was a\nblack colored Lexus, bearing a Vehicle Identification Number of JT8BH68X3W0006181.\nIn front of the Lexus, close to the street was a gray colored Pontiac Grand Prix, bearing a\nVehicle Identification Number of 2G2WP522441293885. Neither of these vehicles\ncontained a license plate.\nAfter documenting the blood trail and the exterior of the residence, Detective Morton\nentered through the aforementioned front door, which was ajar. Detective Morton noted\nthat interior of the residence was small and somewhat cluttered. The temperature inside\nof the house felt like a comfortable 72 degrees. The first room encountered after entering\nthe front door appeared to be a living room of sorts. The walls in this room were painted\na white color, as were all the walls inside of the residence. The flooring consisted of a\nwhite colored ceramic tile and was continuous throughout the residence. Typical living\nroom furniture was observed in the room, such as a coffee table, a television and a\ncomputer desk. Detective Morton also noted other items, such as lawn equipment in this\nroom. Detective Morton located a piece of wood, which was similar to that of a section of\ndoor frame. Detective Morton checked the interior front door and observed that a piece\nwas missing from its intended location and was on the floor in the first room. On top of\nthe coffee table, which was near the south wall of the room was a laptop computer, which\nappeared to be on. Detective Morton noted smeared blood on the floor as well as blood\non the lid of a translucent container which was in the middle of the first room on the\nfloor. In furtherance, Detective Morton could sense that a disturbance happened in this\nroom, based on the haphazard placement of the furniture and the apparent blood found\nthroughout.\nTo the southwest of the first room, Detective Morton encountered an opening in the\nwall construction which lead to four other rooms. From this entranceway, Detective\nMorton noted a bathroom to the north side of the residence, a kitchen to the west side of\nthe residence, with an attached laundry room, a bedroom decorated in a children's theme\nto the southwest of the residence and another bedroom to the east. Detective Morton\nnoted that there were two orange evidence cones marking items of evidentiary value in\nthe interior of the residence. These cones were identified as numbers 1 and 2. Detective\nMorton noted that cone #1 was near the doorway of the bathroom between the kitchen\nand the living room. In furtherance, Detective Morton observed that cone #1 marked a\nspent bullet casing, which was located behind a partially used bag of Beneful brand dry\ndog food. Cone #2 was located in the southwest bedroom and that it marked a silver and\nblack colored semi-automatic handgun. The kitchen was furnished with common\nhousehold appliances. In addition to these appliances, Detective Morton observed a\ncopious amount of shoe boxes and plastic bags containing an assortment of white and\nblack colored T-shirts.",
