The structure consisted of a single\nstory and comprised of a yellow colored brick. The front of the structure contained a\nwhite colored front door, which was illuminated by an overhead porch light and was\ncovered by a small overhang. Above this door, Detective Morton observed a small\nsurveillance camera mounted to the wall.

The vehicle parked nearest to the residence was a\nblack colored Lexus, bearing a Vehicle Identification Number of JT8BH68X3W0006181.\nIn front of the Lexus, close to the street was a gray colored Pontiac Grand Prix, bearing a\nVehicle Identification Number of 2G2WP522441293885. Neither of these vehicles\ncontained a license plate.\nAfter documenting the blood trail and the exterior of the residence, Detective Morton\nentered through the aforementioned front door, which was ajar. Detective Morton noted\nthat interior of the residence was small and somewhat cluttered. The temperature inside\nof the house felt like a comfortable 72 degrees. The first room encountered after entering\nthe front door appeared to be a living room of sorts. The walls in this room were painted\na white color, as were all the walls inside of the residence. The flooring consisted of a\nwhite colored ceramic tile and was continuous throughout the residence. Typical living\nroom furniture was observed in the room, such as a coffee table, a television and a\ncomputer desk. Detective Morton also noted other items, such as lawn equipment in this\nroom. Detective Morton located a piece of wood, which was similar to that of a section of\ndoor frame. Detective Morton checked the interior front door and observed that a piece\nwas missing from its intended location and was on the floor in the first room. On top of\nthe coffee table, which was near the south wall of the room was a laptop computer, which\nappeared to be on. Detective Morton noted smeared blood on the floor as well as blood\non the lid of a translucent container which was in the middle of the first room on the\nfloor. In furtherance, Detective Morton could sense that a disturbance happened in this\nroom, based on the haphazard placement of the furniture and the apparent blood found\nthroughout.\nTo the southwest of the first room, Detective Morton encountered an opening in the\nwall construction which lead to four other rooms. From this entranceway, Detective\nMorton noted a bathroom to the north side of the residence, a kitchen to the west side of\nthe residence, with an attached laundry room, a bedroom decorated in a children's theme\nto the southwest of the residence and another bedroom to the east. Detective Morton\nnoted that there were two orange evidence cones marking items of evidentiary value in\nthe interior of the residence. These cones were identified as numbers 1 and 2. Detective\nMorton noted that cone #1 was near the doorway of the bathroom between the kitchen\nand the living room. In furtherance, Detective Morton observed that cone #1 marked a\nspent bullet casing, which was located behind a partially used bag of Beneful brand dry\ndog food. Cone #2 was located in the southwest bedroom and that it marked a silver and\nblack colored semi-automatic handgun. The kitchen was furnished with common\nhousehold appliances. In addition to these appliances, Detective Morton observed a\ncopious amount of shoe boxes and plastic bags containing an assortment of white and\nblack colored T-shirts.",
