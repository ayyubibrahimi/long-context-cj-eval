A review of this correspondence reflected that Sergeant Henry Kirsch had received\ninformation from a confidential source relative to the following:\nSeveral locations (1468 North Broad; 2021 Laharpe; and 2000 Esplanade) were operat-\ning as outlets for stolen goods.\nJohn Dupart and Reginald Adams were committing burglaries in the New Orleans East\narea\nFinally, the informant alledgedly overheard Reginal Adams speaking about the murder\nof Cathy Ulfers.\nThe information concerning the fencing operations and the burglaries were forwarded\nby Detective Venezia to the appropriate division within the Major Offense Bureau.\nDetective Venezia immediately began an investigation into the information concerning\nthe murder of Mrs. Ulfers.

Sergeant Kirsch\nreadilly revealed his source of information as Lionel Halphern, presently confined in\nParish Prison awaiting trial on a charge of Armed Robbery. Kirsch stated that Halp-\nhern had supplied this information in an effort to obtain the assistance of law enforce-\nment officials to extricate himself from the armed robbery charges.\nWhen questioned by Detective Venezia as to how the Ulfers's murder information\nsurfaced during Kirsch's interview with Halphern, the Sergeant revealed that it was\nhe, and not Halphern, who first mentioned the murder. Sergeant Kirsch stated that\nhis suspicion was aroused when Halphern mentioned burglaries in the New Orleans East\narea (Mrs. Ulfers was murdered during the perpetration of a burglary on her residence,\nwhich is in the New Orleans East area). It was determined that Sergeant Kirsch, along\nwith the remainder of the Special Investigations Division, had been instructed by their\nsuperiors to question all informanta relative to the Ulfers's Murder.\nPer the request of Detective Venezia, Lionel Halphern was transported to the Spec-\nial Investigations Division's Office for the purpose of an interview. This interview\nwas conducted by Detective Venezia on Monday, February 11, 1980, from 4:40 P.M. to\n5:25 P.M. Halphern disclosed sundry information during this interview, however, the\nmajority of it did not apply to the murder investigation. When questioned directly\nabout the murder of Mrs. Ulfera, Halphern feigned ignorance. Upon further questioning\nby Detective Venezia, Halphern stated that he had heard \"from talk in the street\" that\nAdams and Dupart were involved in the murder. However, Halphern refused to reveal this\nsource of information, stating that he couldn't recall the names of the people who had\nstated this. Halphern did state that if Detective Venezia could arrange his release\nfrom Parish Prison, he (Halphern) would seek further information. It became apparent\nto Detective Venezia, due to the unsurenesss of Halphern relative to details of his\ninformation, that Halphern was repeating, at best, second-hand information. Further\nthere was the distinct possibility that Halphern was enchancing the information he had\nreceived, in an effort to magnify his importance to the investigation. Therefore, the\ninterview was concluded.\nIn response to this information, Detective Venezia performed the following tasks:\nTechnician George Buisson was instructed to compare the fingerprints of John Dupart\nand Reginald Adams to the latent prints recovered from the Ulfers's residence(Tech-\nnician Buisson later reported that the subjects prints were not among the recovered\nREPORTING OFFICER\nREPORTING OFFICER\nNOPO ACCESS NUMBER\nBADGE\nBADGE\n147\nMartin Venezia\nCERTIFIED DA OFFICE COPY",

It should be noted that Detective Venezia was also conducting other\nHomicide Investigations during the course of the Ulfers's investigation.\nThe next item of information on the Ulfers's investigation, along the same vein\nas the Halphern disclosure, was received by Detective Venezia via an interoffice corr-\nespondence from Sergeant Henry Kirsch, on Friday, March 14, 1980. This correspondence\nwas a repeat of the previously received correspondence from Sergeant Kirsch, however,\ncontained greater detail. Such as, the individual who was buying the stolen property\ngained by John Dupart and Reginald Adama through their burglaries, was a white male\nnamed \"Tony\" who operated from Broadview Seafood, located 1468 North Broad. From Det-\nective Venezia's personal knowledge, this white male individual would be Anthony Cal-\ncagno, the brother of the owner of Broadview Seafood, Steve Calcagno. Anthony Calcagno\nis a well known \"'Police Character\", who specializes in the disposal of stolen goods.\nAnother name mentioned in the new information was John Santinac. Through checking this\nindividual through the Motion files, Detective Venezia learned that Santinac was pre-\ngently confined in Pariah prison on a charge of Armed Robbery.\nPursuant to the investigation, on Wednesday, March 19, 1980, at 6:15PM :, Detective\nVenezia conducted an interview with Santinac in the Criminal Sheriff's Special Invest-\nigations Division's Office. Santinac was not a cooperative interviewee, therefore, no\n...\nfurther information was garnered. Detective Venezia did leave his name and office\ntelephone number with Santinac on the possibility that Santinac might decide to become\ncooperative in the future.\nSantinac's name was also supplied to Technician Buisson in order to compare his\nfingerprints to the latent prints recovered from the scene of the murder, This also\nproved negative.\nBADGE\nREPORTING OFFICER\nNOPO ACCESS NUMBER\nREPORTING OFFICER\nBADGE\n1475\nMartin Venezia\nCERTIFIED DA OFFICE COPY",

On Monday, May 6, 1980, Detective Venezia received a telephone message that John\nSantinac wanted to speak to him. Detective Venezia determined that Santinac was still\nconfined in Parish Prison, having been sentenced to six months for violation of parola\n(the armed robbery charge had been dismissed the the District Attorney's Office for\nlack of evidence). On the following day, Tuesday, May 7, 1980, Detective Venezia con-\nducted a lengthy interview with Santinac in the Special Investigations Division's Off-\nice. The information gleaned from this interview is as follows.\nOver the past several years, Santinac has committed several residence and business\nburglaries with John Dupart, Raymond Dupart, and Reginald Adams. On occassions, it\nwould be Santinac and any one or all of the named individuals, who would commit these\nburglaries. According to Santinac, the property gathered during these burglaries would\nbe sold to a white male named \"Suitcase Tony\" -- this is an alias by which Anthony Calcagno\nis well known. It was Santinac's belief, based upon conversations with his confeder-\nates, that Calcagno would choose the intended victims, conduct the necessary surveilance\nand supply this information to John Dupart. It was then Dupart, who furthered the con-\nspiracy by actually committing the burglary with whomever he chose. The fruits of the\nburglary were invariably sold to Calcagno. However, all of the trnasactions involving\nCalcagno were conducted only with John Dupart. None of the orther members of the burg-\nlary group were physically present during the transfer of information and/or stolen\ngoods. This did not preclude them from being in the same residence where the transfer\nwould occur, but they would not be privy to any inculpatory acts of Calcagno.\nAs regards the Ulfers's murder, Santinac recalls overhearing Calcagno telling\nRaymond Dupart, \"Reggie and your brother fucked-up, they shouldn't have shot the broad.\"\nAccording to Santinac, this conversation occurred inside of Mel's Upholstery Shop,\nlocated 2000 Touro Street, sometime in the early part of @ctober, 1979. Santinac re-\nvealed the following details concerning this conversation.\nSantinac was walking toward Mel's Shop, and upon reaching the front door, observed\nCalcagno, Raymond Dupart and the owner, known to Santinac as Mel, standing together\njust inside the doorway. Calcagno was facing away from the door and was exclaiming\nthe above quotation to Raymond Dupart. Just after this statement, Calcagno became\naware of Santinac's presence and stopped the conversation.\nBecause Santinac could not reveal any further details, combined with the fact that\nREPORTING OFFICER\nREPORTING OFFICER\nBADGE\nBADGE\nNOPD ACCESS NUMBER\nMartin Venezia\n1475\nCERTIFIED DA OFFICE COPY",

The interview was\nconcluded with no further information gathered.\nOn Tuesday, May 7, 1980, at about 4:00 P.M ., Detective Venezia proceeded to the\n2000 block of Touro Street and observed a one story, beige brick structure with \"Mel's\nUpholstery Shop\" written across one window. This structure had only one observable\npoint of ingress, that being a doorway opening onto the downtown-lake corner of Touro\nand North Johnson Streets. At the time Detective Venezia passed the shop, it appeared\nto be closed for business.\nAfter consultation with Lieutenant Ronald Reyes, the Commander of the Homicide\nUnit during this period of time, it was decided to forward this information to the\ncareer Offenders Unit, and have them conduct the necessary investigation into the Du-\nparts and Calcagno. In the event any of these parties would be apprehended for a crime\nthey would be questioned at that time for knowledge of the Ulfers's Murder.\nThis tact was chosen because of the tenuous nature of the information and the fact that\nall the involved parties were professional criminals, who have proven themselves to be\nuncooperative with law enforcement agencies, unless they had something to barter for,\nsuch as, if they themselves were charged with a crime. There were no results from this\nrequest.\nIt should be noted at this time, that investigation into this lead was stymied\nbecause of a lack a common denominator between the listed criminals and the Ulfers's\nfamily. Further, the investigating detective is aware that Calcagno limits his crimes\nto the major type, where he would gain a substantial amount of money. Nothing about\nthe Ulfera's residence, or their lifestyles, would render the Ulfers's residence a\npotential target of a Calcagno inspired burglary, Both of these points were later\nestablished in further investigation, which shall be enumerated later in this narratives\nThe next major occurrance of this case occurred on Monday, August 4, 1980, when\nDetective Venezia received a telephone call from Sergeant Frank Ruiz, the chief invest-\nigator for the District Attorney's Office, requesting that he, Venezia, immediately\ncome over to his, Ruiz's, office.

Item Number F-21333-80\nDuring Sgt. Ruiz's office's investigation into this burglary, they effected the arrest\nof John Dupart, Raymond Dupart, and Reginald Adams, charging them with this burglary --\nthese arrest all occurred on July 31, 1980. Sergeant Ruiz also developed very reliable\ninformation that Anthony Calcagno had \"aet-up\" the SeaFood City burglary, however, Cal-\ncagno had not been arrested at this time for lack of sufficient, admissiable evidence.\nAlso during the investigation, Sergeant Ruiz had interviewed a Marguritte Santinac\nwho stated, in addition to her information relative to the burglary, that Reginald\nAdams had committed the murder of Cathy Ulfers. Sergeant Ruiz had just received this\ninformation from Miss Santinac, who was presently in an adjoining office, which prompt-\ned the telephone call to Detective Venezia.\nAfter Detective Venezia advised Sergeant Ruiz of the information he had received\nconcerning these same subjects, the two investigators decided to conduct a joint in-\nvestigation into the possible involvement of Dupart, Adams, and Calcagno in the murder\nof Cathy Ulfers.\nPursuant to this, Detective Venezia and Sergeant Ruiz interviewed Miss Santinac in\nSergeant Ruiz's office. According to Miss Santinac, she had learned from a black male\nsubject, age 16, known to her as \"PeeWee\", that Adama had murdered the Policeman's wife\non Downman Road. The subject\"Pee Wee\" had since become the victim of a murder himself.\nMiss Santinac did not know this individual's correct name, however, she was positive\nthat \"Pee Wee's\" murder was not related to the Ulfers killing. Miss Santinac stated\nthat she had no further information, beyond what she had learned from this subject.\nIn an attempt to verify the information concerning Dupart and Adama, Detective\nVenezia and Sergeant Ruiz requested Miss Santinac to seek out John Dupart and engage\nhim in a conversation concerning the Ulfers murder. During this conversation, Mias\nSantinac was to have a Microphone concealed on her person to record what transpired.\nMiss Santinac readilly agreed to this and immediate arrangements were made with the\nCareer Offender Unit to effect the necessary surviellance and implating of a microphone\non the person of Miss Santinac. After all the details were attended to, Misa Santinac\nmet with John Dupart, at about 6:30 P.M ., this date, and engaged him in conversation.\nHowever, the tape recording received from this exchange was largely unreadable, due to\na faulty battery pack attached to the microphone, The segments of the recording that\nREPORTING OFFICER\nREPORTING OFFICER\nBADGE\nNOPO ACCESS NUMBER\nBADGE\nMartin Venezia\"\n1475\nCERTIFIED DA OFFICE COPY",

Ruiz's Office.\nThere was\nsome aligh't indication of Adam's involvement in the Ulfers's murder in this tape, but\nthe information was very ambiguous.\nOn Tuesday, August 5, 1980, Detective Venezia determined that the owner of the\nupholstery shop was a Melvin Patnett, negro male, date of birth -- November 12, 1926, re-\nsiding 5919 Pauline Street. A check of Patnett through the MOTION files disclosed that\nhe was wanted for simple criminal damage, under N.O. P.D. Item Number -- D-26137-80. A\nreview of the report filed under this item number revealed that a Miss Deane Clemans,\nnegro female, age 32, residing 5404 St. Roch Street, was the individual who filed the\ncomplaint against Patnett. In order to gain background information on Mr. Patnett,\nDetective Venezia telephone Mass Clemans and set an appointment for the following day\nat Miss Cleman's residence.\nOn Wednesday, August 6, 1980, at 9:30 A.M ., Detective Venezia interviewed Miss\nClemans, who could supply nothing concerning the Ulfer's murder. She did advise the\nDetective that Mel. Patnett was her ex-boyfriend, but that they had not seen each other\nsince April 25, 1980, when he caused damage to her vehicle. Clemans related that dur-\ning her association with Patnett, they would often double date with John Dupart, who was\napparently a very good friend of Patnett. Upon conclusion of this interview, Miss\nClemans stated that she still wished to prosecute Patnett for the damage done to her\nvehicle.\nLater that same day, at about 11: 30 A.M ., Detective Venezia met with Sergeant Ruiz\nin the Office of the District Attorney, in order to compare noted concerning the in-\nvestigation to date. After a period of consultation, both officers decided to again\nquestion John Santinac and Marguerite Santinac, as they felt that neither party was\ncompletely truthfull. Therefore, Sergeant Ruiz instructed members of his command to\nLocate and transport Miss Santinac to the Office and have John Santinac removed from the\ncustody of the Criminal Sheriff's Office and also brought to Sergeant Ruiz's Office.\nBetween noon and 1:30 P.M ., Sergeant Ruiz and Detective Venezia interviewed John\nand Margurite Santinac, both separately, and at one point together-the latter was done\nto convince Marguerite Dantinac that her brother John was in face cooperating with the\ninvestigators The result of these interviews was the determination that it was Mar-\nguerite Santinac, and not John Santinac, who had overheard Patnett, Calcagno, and\nRaymond Dupart discussing the Ulfer's murder.\nREPORTING OFFICER\nREPORTING OFFICER\nBADGE\nBADGE\nNOPD ACCESS NUMBER\n1475\nMartin Venezia .\nCERTIFIED DA OFFICE COPY",

After Raymond Dupart had\npulled to the curbing, Patnett leaned toward the driver's window and made a statement to\nthe effect that Reginald shouldn't have killed the lady. It was at this point, that\nPathett became aware of Miss Santinac's presence in the vehicle and did not continue\nthe conversation, but rather invited Raymond Dupart into the upholstery shop.

Mr. D'Antonio was apprised of the charges placed against his client by Miss\nClemans, but that Miss Clemans apparently only wanted monetary compensation for the\ndamages to her vehicle. Therefore, Patnett was not charged in Central Lock-up with\nthese charges, allowing D'antonio time to have the matter resolved without the nec-\nessity of an arrest.\nWhile this information would lead to a belief that John Dupart and Reginald Adams\nwere possibly involved in the murder of Cathy Ulfers, it was definitely not enough\nprobable cause to effect the arrest of either party.

On August 30, 1980, John Dupart was\nreleased from Parish Prison after posting a Seventy-five Thousand Dollar bond. Re-\nginald Adams was surrendered by his bondsman on September 8, 1980, and was unable to\nraise sufficient monies for his bond. He therefore remained in prison until he was\nadditionally charged with the Ulfers murder.\nSeveral avenues of investigation were pursued over the course of the next several\nweeks, most of which have no hearing on the prosecution of the arrested idividuals.\nThe majority of the investigation during this time period was of a background nature\nand the contacting of informants. It was learned that Calcagno had been seeking a Pol-\nice Radio sometime around the early part of October, 1979, and had discontinued his\nsearch in the latter part of October, 1979. However, this information was received from\ninformants, who could not testify directly to this, having only known of it from other\nmembers of the criminal element.\nOf note during this portion of the investigation, was a request made by Detective\nWerry llesin to Sergeant Charles Little of the Criminal Sheriff's Office .
