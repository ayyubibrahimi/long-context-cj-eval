And speaking of being in two places at one time,\nthen the question arises, well, where was Jimmy Bass? The\nproof will show that his mother, Gloria Bass, is going to\ntestify that her son was home\nthat evening and had been\nhome for a long period of time. His sister, Brenda Bass, is\ngoing to testify that she knew where her brother was, meaning.\nat home. His brother, Forrest Bass, is going to testify where\nhe knew his little brother was, at home.\nNow, there will be some testimony that, yes, in fact,\nJimmy Bass did leave home that evening, but it was only after\nthis robbery was to have taken place, Brenda Bass, his\nsister, had gone to the store and while she was out this\nhappened. In fact, I think she is going to testify that she\nsaw some police cars and possibly an ambulance responding to\nthis robbery there at 61 Quiki. There was a lot of commotion\nand there were a lot of police cars, a lot of movement going\non, and she became immediately aware of it and when she and\nher friend went back to her mother's house, the proof will\nshow that she informed her mother that there had been a rob-\nbery at 61 Quiki and the lady that worked there at 61 Quiki\nhad been robbed and at that time she knew that her little\nbrother was at home. Only after that did Jimmy Bass leave\nthe house. The proof will show that Jimmy Bass was not at\nthe 61 Quiki that night, -- any time that night nor was he\nwith Markius Thomas. Thank you.",

Under\n609, Your Honor, the fact that this witness is not even an\nadult, would take it out of that rule, starting off, the\nfact that he is only 15 years old. And the purpose of 609\nis keep juvenile adjudications from coming back to haunt an\nadult. And Kee Kee is 15 years old and he hasn't reached the.\nage of eighteen yet.

He doesn't need to\njust ask, open-ended, whether or not we made any promises,\nwhich we have not made him any promises.\nBY THE COURT: First of all, Section 43-21-561,\nMississippi Code of 1972 was passed in 1980 and so far as\nI know, and I was looking in the back of the code to be sure ,,\nhas not been amended -- (Court looking at the code) and\nthe 1988 supplement does not show that it was amended. The\nrule of evidence, when they were adopted by the Mississippi\nSupreme Court, repealed all laws, rules and directions and\nanything else that were in conflict with them. I am not\nsaying this statute is in conflict as far as showing bias\nand interest is concerned. I think the defense has a right\nto cross-examine the witness as to any bias or interest\nwhich would include any possible offers or would induce him\nfor the state. It is cross-examination and\nto testify\nyou have the right to ask him about that, if anybody has\nmade him any offers or concessions and to test his credibility\nin that way. So that part of the statute is not in conflict\nwith the rule .. As I have already said, I will allow you to\ncross-examine him, both you and Mr. Atkinson. Beyond that,\nI do think that Rule 609 does control and they are basically\nin accord with what 561 says and, that is, evidence of\njuvenile adjudication is generally not admissible under this\nrule, unless you can show bias or interest. What the\nMississippi Supreme Court has said, in addition to that, they\ndo not want to try defendants, or for that matter, witnesses,\n-- what they want is something that will go to credibility.\nIf a former conviction would go to credibility of a defen-\ndant, what is known as a crimen falsi, whether he be adult\nor juvenile, it could be used.

She had suffered a gunshot wound to her abdomen\nand to the lower part of her stomach and to her leg and\nI was asked to see her because of those wounds.\n. And what was her condition?\n0\nA. The condition at the time was extremely critical.\nShe had lost so much blood at the time that we couldn't even\nget a blood pressure on her. Her heart was beating much\nfaster than normal. It was beating faster than normal\nbecause when you have lost that much blood your heart --\nthe heart rate increases in an attempt to circulate what\nlittle blood is remaining. So we could not get a blood\npressure on her. She was in obvious critical condition.\nQ. Okay. And what was done?\nA. Well, immediately we started giving her some\nblood to try to replace what was lost. We then carried her !\nup to surgery as soon as we could get a blood pressure back .\non her and did emergency surgery on her.\nQ. Do you recall if she was given -- or how many\nunits of blood she was given?\nA. It was about 14 or 15 units. Normally, a person\nhas around four to six units of blood in their body,\nnormally.

Later, something additional\nwas said about it and Mr. Atkinson made some statement\nabout it and I can't really remember what was said but if\nMrs. Tice can find it, that would be helpful.

Now, I emphasize\nthat. If anyone tries to approach you about this case,\nit is a violation of law for anyone to do so and it would\nbe very important for you to report it if anyone should do\nthat. It would be a violation of law if you failed to\nreport it. Assemble in the jury room at 9:30.\nAt this time, court is in recess until 9:30 in the\nmorning,",

Looking at the testimony in the light most\nfavorable to the Defendant, Your Honor, the lady that got\nrobbed could not identify the defendant Jimmy Bass. The\nonly direct testimony linking the defendant to the armed\nrobbery is the highly suspect testimony of one Keith\nThompson and by his own admission the closest that he could\nput Jimmy Bass, according to what he marked on Mr. Mellen's\n=====\nState's exhibit 11, the diagram, and it is not to scale,\nand in fact there is one measurement and I gauged it from\nthat measurement -- the closest he could put Jimmy Bass to\n61 Quiki is around 450 to 500 feet. Then the only other\nthing you have is the Anita Thompson statement. It was\ngotten into evidence or played into evidence by Mr. Serio.\nBut on the stand she recanted all of that. The evidence is\nnot there, Your Honor, to put Jimmy Bass either at the 61\nQuiki or near the 61 Quiki or actually in concert with any-\none at the 61 Quiki on the evening of July 17.'\nBY THE COURT: Well, as the Court recalls, the victim\nin the case, Mary Townsend, did state that he looked\nexactly like the person who had done this, but she could\nnot absolutely and unqualifiedly identify him. So it is a\nmatter of credibility and what the jury could infer from\nthe evidence that has been presented. In the event the\njury reached a determination -- and they are the finder of\nfacts -- that he was guilty, the Court does not feel that it\nwould be against the overwhelming weight of the evidence.\nSo the Court will deny the motion for a directed verdict\nas to the Defendant Jimmy Bass.\nBY THE COURT: All right.
