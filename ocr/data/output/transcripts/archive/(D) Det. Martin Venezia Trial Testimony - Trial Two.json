The rest of the things that\n15\nhe told me matched the facts very, very accurately.\nBut, now, if he would then go with me and pick the\n16\nhouse out in New Orleans and walk through the crime\n17\nscene and show me where she laid and where her property\n18\nwas stolen from, that adds so much more credence to\n19\nhis confession, because only the killer and myself\n20\nknew that. In fact, he knew a little more than me.\n21\nHe knew that she moaned on the ground when she was\n22\nshot the first time and they leaned over and shot\n23\nher a few more times. I wasn't aware of that.\n24\nQ\nBut, you play acted where she lay down on the ground, how\n25\nshe fell and so forth --\n26\nA\nMyself ,. no, sir.\nThere was -- there was a reinactment of the alleged crime\n28\n29\nscene- -\nA\nThree time.\n30\nQ\nHuh?\n31\nA\nThere was three reinactments.

And, when he first did it, and when he\n7\nstood over her or stood over Mr. Cannon, rather, and\n8\nput his hand like a gun directly to the back of\n9\nFreddie Cannon's head and that's when I asked him\n10\nduring this non-taped part, I said, \"So, you shot her\n. 11\nin the back of the head?\" And, he says, \"Oh, no, no,\n12\n13\nno, I backed up like this and I shot her in the back,\nwhich does not fact -- which does not fit the facts\n14\n15\nof the crime. She was in fact shot three times in the\nback of the head. And, I don't know why he -- he\n16\n17\npositioned himself to shoot her in the head and then\nwhen I asked him, he backed off that part. And, then\n18\nduring the tape recording statement, he again had\n19\nCannon lay down and again, placed Cannon . in the\n20\nsame position and this time, he showed me how he\n21\nshot her in the back, not toward the head the way\n22\nhe took position. He stood there. And, he pointed\n23\nto the spot in the back on Freddie Cannon's back\n24\nwhere she was shot which in fact coincides with the\n25\ntwo wounds to Ms. Ulfer's back. The third time, we\n26\nwere at the house in the doorway where he showed me\nhow she was laying, where her head was and where her\n28\npurse was, where he was standing when he first shot\n29\nher and how he stepped forward and shot her again.\n50\nThree times.\n31\n.48",

Pardon\n24\nme. It was the admission that it was no contract\n25\nkilling. The actual price that he got from the\n26\ngoods stolen kind of matches what you would get for\n27\nthat type of property. And, the police jacket, in\n28\nthe first hearing the police jacket was not mentioned\n29\nI don't think.
