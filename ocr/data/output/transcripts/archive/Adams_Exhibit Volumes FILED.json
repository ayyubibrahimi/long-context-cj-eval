C. Cr. P. art. 930.3(1), the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and\nArticle 1, Sections 2, 13, 16, 22 and 24 of the Louisiana Constitution, to vacate Mr. Adams's\n1990 conviction of second degree murder and sentence of life without parole. The parties further\nmove this Court to order his immediate release from the custody of the Department of\nCorrections. In support of this motion, the State and the Petitioner represent to this Court the\nfollowing, which is supported by the attached exhibits 1-13.\n1. Mr. Adams was indicted on October 9, 1980, for the first degree murder of Cathy Ulfers,\nwho was shot and killed at her home at 3973 Downman Road, New Orleans on October 7, 1979.\nMr. Adams was originally tried on August 10-12, 1983 at a trial in which Ronald Bodenheimer\nand Harold Gilbert represented the State of Louisiana. Mr. Adams was convicted of first degree\nmurder and sentenced to life in prison. His conviction was reversed by the Louisiana Supreme\nCourt in 1989. State v. Adams, 550 So.2d 595 (La. 1989). Mr. Adams was re-tried for the same\nmurder, with the indictment amended to second degree murder, in 1990. Exhibit 9. Different\nassistant district attorneys prosecuted the second trial. The evidence against Mr. Adams at both\ntrials consisted exclusively of a confession to the murder, made to Detectives Martin Venezia\nand Frank Ruiz while Mr. Adams was in the custody of the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff's\nOffice. Exhibit 1. Mr. Adams was convicted by a jury with a verdict of 10-2 and sentenced to\nmandatory life without parole. Exhibit 9. The \"confession\" was in many ways inaccurate and\ninconsistent with the known facts of Cathy Ulfers's murder. Exhibits 1, 2.\nPage 1 of 4 .\nEXHIBIT\n6\ntabbies*\n----....-.",

Before his first trial, the defense filed in a timely fashion a Motion for Bill of Particulars,\nDiscovery and Inspection; a Motion for Bill of Particulars; and a Motion for Discovery and\nInspection. Exhibit 4(a-c). Those motions included a request for the \"reports of any scientific\nexamination and tests which were conducted in the case [including] any and all ballistics tests\nand experiments.\" Exhibit 4a. They also included a request asking, \"[w]hat items or substances\nwere seized by the State relative to this matter?\" and \"[w]hat is the exact location from which\neach of these items or substances were seized?\" and \"[w]ho ran tests or analysis of the items and\nsubstances involved herein?\" Exhibit 46. The same motion asked, \"[d]oes the State know or any\nof its witnesses know of any person who has information exculpatory as to the defendant, and if\nso, who is that person and what is the basis of his or her information?\" Id. The defense also\nasked the State to, \"describe in detail any and all evidence or information that the State has,\neither in its possession or which it has knowledge of, that would arguably tend to exculpate or\nhelp the defendant in the preparation of his defense or to impeach any witness that the State\nintends in this prosecution?\" Id. The defense also made general requests for results of scientific\ntests and exculpatory evidence. Exhibit 4c. The State's discovery responses answer each of these\nquestions with \"none\", \"not applicable\" or \"n/a.\" Exhibits 4d-f. .\n3. Additionally the two homicide detectives who testified at Mr. Adams's first trial (Sam\nGebbia and Martin Venezia) misrepresented that no evidence or other suspects had been found in\nthe case until Mr. Adams confessed. Exhibit 8. Only Det. Venezia testified at the second trial.\nHe again falsely testified under oath that no evidence or suspects were found until Mr. Adams\nconfessed. Id.\nA review of the District Attorney's files in this and related matters indicates that there\n4.\nwas manifest intentional prosecutorial misconduct by the two prosecutors who prepared and tried\nthe case in Mr. Adams's first trial, namely Ronald Bodenheimer and Harold J. Gilbert Jr ., and\nthat the responses filed by prosecutors Bodenheimer and Gilbert to the enumerated discovery\nrequests above were knowingly and materially false. A detailed supplemental police report,\nauthored by Detectives Gebbia and Venezia, shows that the gun used to kill Cathy Ulfers and\njewelry stolen from the Ulfers' home at the time of the murder were recovered by police within a\nmonth of the crime and traced to two people who had no connection to Mr. Adams. Exhibit 2.\nPage 2 of 4",

            "page_content": "-.\nOne of those people, Roland Burns, was, in fact, arrested for accessory to the murder and\ncharged by the District Attorney's Office with possession of stolen property from the Ulfers\nhome. Exhibits 2, 12. After Mr. Adams's first murder trial, these documents were not placed in\nthe District Attorney's file relating to the homicide prosecution of Mr. Adams nor were they\nrevealed to the defense lawyers in the second trial or the prosecutors in the second trial.\n5. This police report, which relates to the murder, was likewise not contained in the District\nAttorney's file on the homicide, but was instead placed in the District Attorney's file on the\nsecond charge against Mr. Adams -- a burglary charge of which Mr. Adams was acquitted: case\nnumber 277-976 \"C\"-which Mr. Bodenheimer and Mr. Gilbert also prosecuted prior to the first\nmurder trial of Mr. Adams. The report was also contained in the District Attorney's file on the\nRoland Burns charge (Orleans Parish Case No. 273-259 \"C\"). Exhibit 12. However, in no way\nwas this patently exculpatory and highly favorable evidence revealed to the attorneys defending\nMr. Adams in either trial or the prosecutors handling the second trial.\n6.\nTherefore, in clear violation of the Fourteenth Amendment right to Due Process, as\noutlined in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and its progeny, there was an intentional\nsuppression of material, exculpatory evidence by the two original prosecutors and false\ninformation provided by the detectives at Mr. Adams's trial. If this evidence had not been\nintentionally withheld, it could have and would have been used by the defense to undermine\nsubstantially the State's case against Mr. Adams, cast further doubt on the credibility of Mr.\nAdams's confession, and demonstrate third party guilt. Because the misrepresentations made by\nthe assistant district attorneys prosecuting the first trial were relied upon by the prosecutors and\ndefense at the second trial (Exhibit 9) the suppression of the material exculpatory evidence taints\nthe fundamental fairness of, and undermines confidence in, the outcome of both proceedings.\nWHEREFORE, the State and the Petitioner move this Court to grant their joint motion\nfor post-conviction relief, vacate Mr. Adams's conviction and sentence, and order his immediate\nrelease from custody.\nPage 3 of 4",

After the motion was granted Monday morning, the\nDistrict Attorney's office dismissed the case and announced that it does not intend to retry\nAdams.

            "page_content": "police officers engaged in the investigation of Ulfers murder and misconduct of certain Assistant\nDistrict Attorneys responsible for prosecuting the case against Adams in 1983.\nIn preparation for filing an application for post-conviction relief for Adams, his attorneys\nreviewed public records relating to his investigation and trial. The documents revealed that\ncertain police and prosecutors intentionally concealed material evidence that was favorable to\nAdams. Michael Magner, a former Assistant United States Attorney and current partner in the\nlaw firm of Jones Walker, and Emily Maw, the director of the New Orleans Innocence Project,\npromptly authenticated the findings and delivered a detailed report to the District Attorney's\noffice on May 2nd.\nFollowing a quick but thorough review by senior level prosecutors in the office, District\nAttorney Cannizzaro agreed to join the motion of Reginald Adams for a new trial and dismiss the\nmurder case against him. In Response to today's proceedings, District Attorney Leon\nCannizzaro said, \"I will not tolerate intentional misconduct on the part of police or\nprosecutors. Their handling of this case was shameful. Not only did their intentional acts harm\nReginald Adams, who was wrongfully incarcerated for more than three decades, but also it\ndenied this community any opportunity to hold the real perpetrator criminally responsible for this\nviolent crime.\"\nAdditionally, District Attorney Cannizzaro offered an apology to Mr. Adams, \"To Reginald\nAdams I offer a sincere apology. I offer the apology both personally and on behalf of a much\ndifferent office than the office that prosecuted you three decades ago and denied you your right\nto a fair trial.\"\nOn October 7th of 1979, Cathy Ulfers, the wife of an NOPD officer and the daughter of a retired\nNOPD major, was shot seven times in her home in the 3900 block of Downman Road in New\nOrleans East. The perpetrators of the crime ransacked the house and stole several pieces of\njewelry from Ulfers and her husband.\nNOPD homicide detectives Martin Venezia and Sam Gebbia investigated the murder. For nearly\na year the case remained officially unsolved. In September of 1980, Reginald Adams was an\ninmate in the Orleans Parish Prison awaiting trial on a burglary charge unrelated to the Ulfers\nhomicide for which he was ultimately acquitted. However, NOPD Homicide detectives\ninvestigating the Ulfers murder were aware of street rumors that Adams had murdered Cathy\nUlfers.\nWhen Adams requested a meeting with the detectives on his burglary case, detective Venezia\naccompanied one of the detectives on the burglary case to speak with Adams. Following a four\nand a half hour interrogation in which Adams claims to have been given alcohol and narcotics,\nhe made a taped confession. Some of the claims made by Adams in the confession were\ninconsistent with the physical evidence.\n2",

            "page_content": "Following the confession, Adams was arrested by the homicide detectives and charged by the\nDistrict Attorney's office with the murder of Cathy Ulfers. In August of 1983, Assistant District\nAttorneys Ronald Bodenheimer and Harold Gilbert, who were the ADAs who unsuccessfully\ntried Adams on the unrelated burglary charge, tried Adams for the murder of Ulfers. The case\nwas based entirely on the confession of Adams.\nDuring trial and in response to discovery requests, the detectives testified and prosecutors\nclaimed that neither the murder weapon nor any of the property taken from the home were ever\nrecovered by police. Additionally, the detectives testified that no other suspects were ever\ndeveloped or investigated for the murder. Following the trial, Adams was convicted of the\nmurder and received a life sentence.\nIn their review of public records relating to the murder case as well as the unrelated burglary,\nMichael Magner and Emily Maw discovered a supplemental police report detailing the first\nseveral months of the murder investigation in 1979. The report revealed that on October 24th of\n1979 the homicide detectives in this case were notified that a weapon similar to the weapon used\nin the Ulfers murder had been recovered in an arrest. According to the report, the homicide\ndetectives were later informed by an NOPD ballistics expert that the recovered weapon was the\nmurder weapon.\nIn one of the sad ironies of this case, the detectives, based on this discovery, performed a\nthorough follow up investigation that traced the weapon back to two individuals. The detectives\nquestioned and searched one of the two individuals, and they discovered that he was in\npossession of a piece of jewelry that had been taken from the Ulfers' home in the burglary.\nWhile this individual was arrested as an accessory to the murder and for possession of stolen\nproperty and eventually charged by the DA's office with possession of stolen property, the\ncharges were dismissed by prosecutors months before Adams confessed and years before he was\nbrought to trial for the murder of Cathy Ulfers.\nThe testimony given by detectives Venizia and Gebbia at trial was unquestionably inconsistent\nwith the information contained in the supplemental report. Furthermore, the investigation of\nMagner and Maw revealed that the aforementioned report was in the possession of the District\nAttorney's office. They discovered that it was contained in the file regarding the unrelated\nburglary charge against Adams. In light of the fact that Assistant District Attorneys\nBodenhiemer and Gilbert handled both cases, the current administration of the District\nAttorney's office concludes that Bodenheimer and Gilbert were fully aware of the additional\nsuspects as well as the recovery of the murder weapon and other physical evidence and that their\nhandling of this case amounts to intentional prosecutorial misconduct.\n3",

Sergeant Kirnch\nreadilly revealed his source of information as Lionel Halphern, presently confined in\nParish Prison awaiting trial on & charge of Armed Robbery. Kirsch stated that Halp-\nhern had supplied this information in an effort to obtain the assistance of law enforce-\nmest officials to extricate himself From the armed robbery charges,\nWhen questioned by Detective Venezia as to how the Ulfers's murder information\nsurfaced during Kirsch's interview with Halphern, the Sergeant revealed that it was\nhe, and not Halphern, who first mentioned the murder. Sergeant Kirsch stated that\nhis suspicion was aroused when Halphera mentioned burglaries in the New Orleans Bast\narea (Mrs. Ulfers was murdered during the perpetration of a burglary on her residence,\nwhich is in the New Orleans East area). It was determined that Sergeant Kirsch, along\nwith the remainder of the Special Investigations Division, had bean instructed by their\nsuperiors to question all informants relative to the Ulfers's Murder.\nPer the request of Detective Venezia, Lionel Halphern was transported to the Spec-\nial Investigations Division's Office for the purpose of an interview. This interview\nwas conducted by Detective Venezia on Monday, February 11, 1980, from 4:40 P.M. to\n5:25 P.M. Halphern disclosed sundry information during this interview, however, the\nmajority of it did not apply to the murder investigation. When questioned directly\nabout the murder of Mrs. Ulfers, Balphern feigned ignorance. Upon further questioning\nby Detective Venezia, Halphern stated that he had heard \"from talk in the street\" that\nAdams and Duport were involved in the murder. However, Halphern refused to reveal this\nsource of information, stating that he couldn't recall the names of the people who had\natatad thia. Halphern did state that if Detective Venezia could arrange his release\nfrom Parish Prison, he (Helphern) would seek further information. It became apparent\nto Detective Venezia, due to the unsuremasas of Halphern relative to details of his\ninformation, that Halphern was repeating, at best, second-hand information. Further\nthere was the distinct possibility that Haiphern was enchancing the information he had\nreceived, in an effort to magnify his importance to the investigation. Therefore, the\ninterview was concluded.\nIn response to this information, Detective Venezia performed the following taska:\nTechnician George Buisson was instructed to compare the fingerprints of John Dupart\nand Reginald Adams to the latent prints recovered from the Ulfers's residence(Tech-\nnician Buisson Later reported that the subjects prints were not among the reco\nHOPO ACCESS NUMBER\nREPORTING OFFICER\nREPORTING OFFICER\n1475\nMartin Venezia\nCERTIFIED DA OFFICE COPY\n... . ..\n:",

Parish Prison, having been sentenced to six months for violation of parole\n( the armed robbery charge had been dismissed the the District Attorney's Office for\nlack of evidence). On the following day, Tuesday, May 7, 1980, Detective Venezia con-\nducted a Lengthy interview with Santinas in the Special Investigations Division's Off-\nice. The information gleaned from this interview is as follows.\nOver the past several years, Santinac has committed several residence and business\nburglaries with John Dupart, Raymond Dupart, and Reginald Adams. On occassions, it\nwould be Santinac and any one or all of the named individuals, who would commit these\nburglaries. According to Santinac, the property gathered during these burglaries would\nbe sold to a white. male named \"Saitcase Tony\" -- this La an alfae by which Anthony Calcagno\nto well known. It was Santinac's beliaf, based upon conversations with his confeder-\nates, that Calcagno would choose the intended victims, conduct the necessary surveilance\nand supply this information to John Dupart. It was then Dupart, who furthered the con-\nspiracy by actually committing the burglary with whomever he chose. The fruits of the\nburglary were invariably sold to Calcagno. However, all of the trnasactions involving\nCalcagno were conducted only with John Dupart. None of the crther members of the burg-\nLary group were physically present during the transfer of Information and/or stolen\ngoods. This did not preclude them from being in the same residence where the transfer\nwould occur, but they would not be privy to any inculpatory acta of Calcagno.\nAs regards the Ulfers'e murder, Santinac recalls overhearing Calcagno telling\nRaymond Dupart, \"Reggie and your brother Sucked-up, they shouldn't have shot the broad.\nAccording to Santinac, this conversation occurred inside of Mel's Upholstery Shop,\nlocated 2000 Touro Street, sometime in the early part of October, 1979. Santinac re-\nvealed the following details concerning this conversation.\nSantinac was walking toward Mel's Shop, and upon reaching the front door, observed\nCalcagno, Raymond Dupert and the owner, known to Saatinac as Mel, standing together\njust inside the doorway. Calcagno was facing away from the door and was exclaiming\nthe above quotation to Raymond Dupart. Just after this statement, Calcagno became\naware of Santinac': presence and stopped the conversation.\nBecause Santinac could not reveal any further details, combined with the fact that\nREPORTING OFFICER\nNOPD ANGERS NUMBER\nHADOE\nBADGE\nREPORTING OFFICER\n1475\nMartin Venezia\nCERTIFIED DA OFFICE COPY",

The interview was\nconcluded with no further information gathered.\nOn Tuesday, May 7, 1980, at about 4:00 P.M ., Detective Venezia proceeded to the\n2000 block of Touro Street and observed a one story, beige brick structure with \"Mel's\nUpholstery Shop\" written across one window. This atructure had only one, observable\npoint of ingress, that being a doorway opening onto the downtown-lake corner of Touro\nand North Johnson Streets. At the time Detective Venezia passed the shop, it appeared\nto be closed for business.\nAfter consultation with Lieutenant Ronald Reyes, the Commander of the Homicide\nUnit during this period of time, it was decided to forward this information to the\ncareer Offenders Unit, and have them conduct the necessary investigation into the Du-\nparts and Calcagno. In the event any of these parties would be apprehended for a crime\nthey would be questioned at that time for knowledge of the Ulfers'a Murder.\nThis tact was chosen because of the tentous nature of the Information and the fact that\nall the involved parties were professional criminals, who have proven themselves to be\nuncooperative with law enforcement agencies, unless they had something to barter fot,\nsuch as ,, if they themselves were charged with a crime, There were no results from this\nrequest.\nIt should be noted at this time, that investigation into this lend was stymied\nbecause of a lack a common denominator batwenn the listed criminals and the Ulfera's\nfamily. Further, the investigating detective is aware that Calcagno limits his crimes\nto the major type, where he would gain a substantial amount of money. Nothing about\nthe Ulfera's residence, or their lifestyles, would render the Ulfers's residence a\npotential target of a Calcagno inspired burglary, Both of these points were later\nestablished in further investigation, which shall be enumerated later in this narrativel.\nThe next major occurrance of this case occurred on Monday, August 4, 1980, when\nDetective Venezia received a telephone call from Sergeant Frank Ruiz, the chief invest-\nigator for the District Attorney's Office, requesting that he, Venezia, immediately\ncome over to his, Ruiz's, office.

Sergeant Ruiz had just received this\ninformation from Misa Santinao, who was presently in an adjoining office, which prompt-\ned the telephone call to Detactive Venezia.\nAftar Detective Venezia advised Sergeant Ruiz of the information he had received\nconcerning these same subjects, the two investigators decided to conduct # joint in-\nveetigation into the possible Involvement of Dupart, Adams, and Calcagno in the murder\nof Cathy Ulfers.\nPursuant to thia, Detective Venezia and Sergeant Ruiz interviewed Mias Santinac in\nSergeant Ruiz's office. According to Mise Santinac, she had Learned from a black male\nsubject, age 16, known to her as \"Peeled', that Adams had murdered the Policeman's wife\non Downman Road. The subject\"Pee Wee\" had since become the victim of a murder himself.\nMiss Santinac did not know this individual's correct name, however, she was positive\nthat \"Pee Wee's\" murder was not related to the Ulfers killing. Miss Santinac stated\nthat she had no further information, beyond what she had learned from this subject.\nIn an attempt to verify the information concerning Dupart and Adams, Detective\nVenezia and Sergeant Rutz requested Miss Santinac to seek out Joan Dupart and engage\nhim in a conversation concerning the Wifers murder. During this conversation, Miss\nSantinac was to have a Microphone concealed on her person to record what transpired.\"\nMias Santinac readilly agreed to this and immediate arrangements were made with the\nCareer Offender Unit to effect the necessary surviellange and implating of a microphone\non the person of Miss Santinac. After all the details were attended to, Miss Santinac\nmet with John Dupart, at about 6:30 P.M ., this date, and engaged him in conversation.\nHowever, the tape recording received from this exchange was largely unreadable, due to\na faulty battery pack attached to the microphone.

There was\nsome sligh't indication of Adam's involvement in the Uifers's murder in this tape, but\nthe information was very ambiguous.\nOn Tuesday, August $, 1980, Detective Venezia determined that the owner of the\nupholstery shop was a Malvin Patnett, negro mala, date of birth -- November 12, 1926, re-\nsiding 5919 Pauline Street. A check of Patnett through the MOTION files disclosed that\nhe was wanted for simple criminal damage, under M.O.P.D. Item Number -- D-26137-80. A\nreview of the report filed under this item number revealed that a Miss Deane Clemans ,\nnegro female, age 32, residing 5404 St. Roch Street, was the individual who filed the\ncomplaint against Patnett. In order to gain background information on Mr. Patnett,\nDetective Venezia telephone Mesa Clemans and set an appointment for the following day\nat Miss Cleman's residence.\nOn Wednesday, August 6, 1980, at 9:30 A.M ., Detective Venezia Interviewed Miss\nClemens, who could supply nothing concerning the Ulfer's murder. She did advise the\nDetective that Mel Patnett was her ex-boyfriend , but that they had not seen each other\nsince April 25, 1980, when he caused damage to her vehicle. Clemans related that dur-\ning her association with Patnett, they would often double date with John Dupart, who was\napparently a very good friend of Patnett. Upon conclusien of this interview, Mies\nClemans stated that she still wished to prosecute Pacnett for the damage done to her\nvehicle.\nLater that same day, at about II:30 A.M ., Detective Venezia met with Sergeant Ruiz\nin the Office of the District Attorney, in order to compare noted concerning the in-\nvestigation to date, After a period of consultation, both officers decided to again\nquestion John Santinac and Marguerite Sentinac, so they felt that neither party waa '\ncompletely truthfull. Therefore, Sergeant Ruiz instructed members of his command to\nlocate and transport Mies Santinac to the Office and have John Santinac removed from the\ncustody of the Criminal Sheriff's Office and also brought to Sergeant Ruiz's Office .-\nBetween noon and 1:30 P.M ., Sergeant Ruiz and Detective Venezia interviewed John\nand Margurite Santinac, both separately, And at one point together-tha latter was done\nto convince Marguerite Dantinac that her brother John was in faca cooperating with the\ninvestigators The result of these interviews was the determination that it was Mar-\nguerite Santinac, and mot John Santinac, who had overheard Patnatt, Calcagno, and\nRaymond Dupart discussing the Ulfer's nurder .\nBADGE\nREPORTING OFFICER\nREPORTING OFFICER\nSACIGE HOPO ACCESS NUMBER\nMartin Venezia\n1475\nCERTIFIED DA OFFICE COPY",

After a period of time , the\ninterview was stopped, while Marguerite Santinac was located and transported to Ruiz's\noffice. The investigators wished to have Santinac confront Patnett , on the assumption\nthat this confrontation would cause whichaver party that was lieing to admit same.\nAt about 1: 45 P.M ., Santinac and Patnett confronted aach other, however, both\nparties maintained the truth of their previous statements. Santinac, in order to prove\nthat she was being truthfull, offerred to again meet with both Dupart'e with a micro-\nphone taped to har body. Immediate arrangements were made and Miss Santinac met both\nof the Duparte at their place of business, Dupart's Repair Shop, St. Claude and Loulas\nStreets, at 2:35 B.M ., this date. .\nThe entire conversation was recorded and is being retained in Sergeant Ruiz's off-\nice. The gist of this conversation was that the murder of Cathy Ulfers was \" .. for\nReggie ... \" and did not involve either Patnett or Santinac. The tapa is rambling in\nnature, and this investigator feels that it is best for the prosecuting attorney to\nreview same, and arrive at ais on conclusions concerning inculpatory statements of\nJohn and Raymond Dupart. Therefore, the taped conversation will not be enumerated in\nthis narrative.\nWhile Santinac was obtaining the tape recording, Mr. Pathetr had contacted his\nattorney at the suggestion of Detective Venezia.

Fatnett was allowed to depart Ruiz's Office in company with his\nattorney. Mr. D'Antonio was apprised of the charges placed against his client by Miss\nClemana, but that Miss Clemans apparently only wanted monetary compensation for the\ndamages to her vehicle. Therefore, Fatnatt was not charged in Central Lock-up with\nthese charges, allowing D'antonio time to have the matter resolved without the nec-\nessity of an arrest.\nWhile this information would lead to a belief that John Dupart and Reginald Adams\nwere possibly involved in the murder of Cathy Ulfere, it was definitely not enough\nprobable cause to effect the arrest of either party. In order to further the invest-\nigation, it was decided to again enlist the assistance of the Career Offender Unit to\nconduct a surveillance of John Bapart and Anthemy Calcagno -- this did not produce posit-\niva results.\nOn Thursday, August 14, 1980, the Orleans Parish Grand Jury returned Silla of in-\ndictment against John Dupart and Reginald Adama for the burglary of Seafood City. Du-\npart was arrested on Tuesday, August 19, 1980, by Detective John Miller, one of the\nmen assigned to conduct surveillance on Dupart. On August 30, 1980, John Dupart was\nreleased from Parish Prison after posting a Seventy-five Thousand Dollar bond. Re-\nginald Adams was surrendered by his bondaman on September 8, 1980, and was unable to\nraise sufficient monies for bis bond. He therefore remained in prison until he was\nadditionally charged with the Ulfers murder.\nSeveral avenues of investigation wers pursued over the course of the next several\nweeks, most of which have no hearing on the prosecution of the arrested idividuals.\nThe majority of the investigation during this time period was of a background nature\nand the contacting of informants. It was learned that Calcagno had been seeking a Pol-\nice Radio sometime around the early part of October, 1979, and had discontinued his\nsearch in the latter part of October, 1979. However, this information was received from\ninformants, who could not testify directly to this, having only known of it from other\nmembers of the criminal element.\nOf note during this portion of the investigation, was a request made by Detective\nJerry Urato to Sergeant Charles Little of the Criminal Sheriff's Office.

Yea.\nVenezia:\nDo you know what those plaques said?\nAdams :\nNo, I didn't pay no attention to them.\nVenezia:\nWere those plaques something to do with the police department or\njust plaques that said anything?\nAdams :\nJust plaques on the wall, I didn't read none of them.\nVenezia:\nDid anyone take these plaques off the wall?\nAdams :\nJohn might have did it, because he don't like police.\nVenezia:\nI'm asking you, personal knowledge, do you know if someone took the\n....\n...\n:plaques off the wall?\nAdams:\nThey was on there when I went through there and when I came out of there,\nso John took them off the wall.

MILNE:\n19\nWell, because the reason we're here is that Mr.\nAdams - well Mr. Adams was tried twice for this crime.\n20\nThere was a review of the District Attorney's files by our\n21\n22\noffice back in November of last year, revealed manifest\n23\nsubstantial intentional prosecutorial misconduct that was\n24\nconducted by the two Assistant District Attorneys who\n25\nprosecuted that first case.\n26\nTHE COURT:\n27\nIn what year?\n28\nMS. MILNE:\n29\nIn 1983.\n30\nTHE COURT:\n31\nAnd this predated Mr. Cannizzaro's reign.\n32\nMR. MARTIN:\nMARLENE C. RODRIGUEZ, CCR\n4",

MARTIN:\n19\nHe received an unfair trial because the law\nrequires the State to submit to the Defense any information\n20\n21\nthat may exculpate him or would tend to assist him in --\nfavorable to his defense. There was information in the\n22\nfiles in the DA's office, not in the murder file but in\n23\n24\nanother location, that clearly had exculpatory and favorable\n25\ninformation that we believe, had it been presented to him,\n26\nhis conviction would not have been acquired. It would have\n27\nmaterially affected the jury's verdict.\n28\nTHE COURT:\n29\nHe was tried for first degree murder?\n30\nMR. MARTIN:\n31\nI believe so, yes, ma'am.\n32\nTHE COURT:\nMARLENE C.

The court allowed the transcript of his confession\nto be submitted to the jury, and in violation of the Code of\n9\nEvidence which requires no written documents be taken up\n10\ninto the jury room.
