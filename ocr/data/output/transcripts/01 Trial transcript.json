DUFFY:\n4\nJudge, at this time, we move for a directed verdict of acquittal.\n5\nThe State has not met their burden.\n6\nThe only evidence in this case implicating Kendall Gordon was\n7\nthe testimony of Darceleen Commadore who said, in fact, on\n8\nthe stand today he is not guilty of the homicide. He is not\n9\nthe person who was in the house. He did not pull the trigger.\n10\nAnd, to support that, Your Honor, I would direct the Court's attention\n11\nto State v. Ray (spelled phonetically) 249 Southern Second,\n12\n540\n13\nWhen a witness other than the defendant is impeached by the\n14\nadmission of prior inconsistent statement, that statement is\n15\nadmissible only on the issue of credibility and not as substantive\n16\nevidence of the defendant's guilt. And, that the evidence that\n17\ncame in today from Ms. Commadore was that Mr. Gordon was\nnot only not on the scene but he had nothing to do with it, and\n18\nhe is not guilty.\n19\nBY MS. SCHIFFMAN:\n20\nYour Honor, in response, the State would allege that the burden on a\n21\ndirected verdict is that the trier of facts is to view the facts in\n22\nthe light most favorable to the Governing Party, which is the\n23\nState in this case.\n24\nAnd, I believe that the State has presented evidence.\n25\nWhether or not it comes from Ms. Commadore from the witness stand\n26\ntoday or the evidence that we have seen throughout the trial, but\n27\nthe State has given evidence enough for the Judge to at least\n28\ndetermine whether or not this incident occurred, and should not\n29\ngrant a directed verdict as it stands today.\n30\n31\n94\n32",
